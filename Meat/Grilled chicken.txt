Ingredients

4 (8 ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts

¼ cup red wine vinegar

2 teaspoons kosher salt

1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper

½ teaspoon dried thyme

½ teaspoon dried oregano

½ teaspoon dried rosemary

½ teaspoon garlic powder

¼ cup olive oil

1 drizzle olive oil, or as needed

2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley

2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint


For the Whipped Feta:


1 cup full-fat Greek yogurt

8 ounces feta cheese

1 teaspoon finely crushed garlic, or to taste

1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint

1 teaspoon lemon zest

Directions

Cut chicken breasts in half lengthwise.

Combine red wine vinegar, kosher salt, black pepper, cayenne, thyme, oregano, rosemary, and garlic powder in a bowl. Add chicken and toss until thoroughly and evenly coated. Pour in ¼ cup olive oil and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 1 to 12 hours, but 2 to 3 hours is ideal.

Place Greek yogurt in another bowl and crumble in feta cheese. Add garlic, mint, and lemon zest and whip with an electric hand mixer or whisk until light and fluffy. Taste and adjust as needed. Refrigerate until needed.

Preheat a charcoal grill until coals are white and very hot.

Grill chicken over the hot coals for about 4 minutes per side; continue to flip and grill chicken until no longer pink in the center and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of each piece reads at least 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Remove from the grill and let rest for about 5 minutes.

Spread whipped feta onto a serving platter or plate and place chicken over top. Sprinkle with fresh Italian parsley and mint and serve.

Chef's Note:

Any vinegar or other dried herbs and spices will work here. You can also use fresh herbs instead of dried, if preferred.
