Ingredients

6 pork chops

1 teaspoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon seasoning salt

2 egg, beaten

¼ cup all-purpose flour

2 cups Italian-style seasoned bread crumbs

4 tablespoons olive oil

1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup

½ cup milk

⅓ cup white wine

Directions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

Rinse pork chops, pat dry, and season with garlic powder and seasoning salt. Place the beaten eggs in a small bowl. Dredge the pork chops lightly in flour, dip in the egg, and coat liberally with bread crumbs.

Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the pork chops until the breading appears well browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chops to a 9x13-inch baking dish, and cover with foil.

Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. While baking, combine the cream of mushroom soup, milk, and white wine in a medium bowl. Cover the pork chops with the soup mixture. Replace foil, and continue to bake for another 30 minutes.
