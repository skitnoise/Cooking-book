Ingredients

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 tablespoon olive oil

¾ cup finely chopped yellow onion

3 cloves garlic, minced

½ teaspoon crushed red pepper

½ cup vodka

2 ½ cups water

1 (16 ounce) package uncooked penne pasta

2 teaspoons kosher salt

1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes

½ cup heavy cream

⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese

¼ teaspoon ground black pepper

Directions

Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Saute function. Select high temperature setting, and preheat the pot for 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter and oil. Add onion and cook, stirring constantly, until translucent, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and crushed red pepper, and cook, stirring often, for 1 minute.

Pour in vodka and cook until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Cancel Saute function. Stir in water, penne, and salt. Pour tomatoes over penne; do not stir. Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 4 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.

Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Stir in cream and Parmesan cheese; let stand for 3 minutes. Stir in pepper.
